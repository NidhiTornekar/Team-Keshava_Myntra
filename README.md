### Prototype Notice:
This is only a prototype! We have just created basic login, signup pages, with home page, and features like sorting by price tags, searching for products, etc. using React and MongoDB. The cutting-edge feature here is the addition of a trending page, which is just shown in the UI but will be made by integrating models as described above.

### Running the Project:
To run, navigate to the `backend` folder, create a `.env` file with your MongoDB URL, install npm dependencies, then in the `backend` directory, run:
```sh
node server.js

In a split terminal, type npm start to start the front end code.
